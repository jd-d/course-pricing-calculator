## Deployment

This repository is configured to publish the static site in `index.html`
to GitHub Pages. When changes are pushed to the `main` branch, the
`Deploy to GitHub Pages` workflow builds the site and deploys it to the
`github-pages` environment. You can also trigger the workflow manually
from the Actions tab using the **Run workflow** button.
