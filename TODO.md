# TODO

- Consolidate pricing table to display only the buffered price, omitting separate breakeven and buffered values.
- Swap the prominence of prices with and without VAT so the price including VAT is shown as the primary figure, with the VAT-exclusive amount secondary.
- Add an input field after "Students per Class" for "Lesson length (mins)" and use it to append hourly pricing (e.g., "(â‚¬XX/hr)") to each lesson price in the table.
