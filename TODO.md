# TODO

## High Priority (UI/UX)
- [ ] _No open items._

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Add an input field after "Students per Class" for "Lesson length (mins)" and use it to append hourly pricing (e.g., "(â‚¬XX/hr)") to each lesson price in the table.
- [ ] Pre fill the form as is done now but change the 65k to 50k preset. Add a radio button next to the annual target field to decide if targets are gross or net and adjust calculations accordingly.

## Low Priority
- [ ] Auto-select light or dark mode by time of day but add a lock icon next to it the user can press to keep it on either. They can still manually switch the switch (they don't need to actually press the lock first) but it won't auto change if the lock is locked.

## DONE
- [x] Ensure on mobile that the preset buttons appear above the form and reduce the large space that appears on mobile between the blog title and the form (see pic). (2025-09-30)
- [x] Swap the prominence of prices with and without VAT so the price including VAT is shown as the primary figure, with the VAT-exclusive amount secondary. (2025-09-30)
- [x] Consolidate the pricing table to display only the buffered price, omitting separate breakeven and buffered values. (2025-09-30)
